## The Problem
<P> According to our research, the current farming system has significant faults. When a farmer invests his time and money in his plot, he expects to see big returns on both his investment and profit; however, this does not happen when the crops fail. 
One of the most common causes of agricultural failure is people planting crops that aren't fit for a certain field in the hopes of getting a lot of money, but what happens instead is the exact reverse. </p>

<p>Almost every year, at least 15-25 percent of potential crop production is lost, at a time when India needs to increase production while simultaneously ensuring food security and nutrition to meet its expanding consumption needs.</p>
<p>In a country like India, where agriculture employs more than half of the people, it is critical that the industry be made as resilient and problem-free as possible.</p>


<p>Now, delving deeper into the issue, The Hindu daily reports that 60 percent of Indian farmers may face catastrophic losses in 2020.</p>


<p>It is well known that some farmers are unable to plant crops for a few seasons due to a number of variables such as soil conditions, weather, and so on, and that they occasionally end up planting crops that are not suitable for their land. </p>

<p>If they are made aware of the favourable crops and other conditions, they can have a very fruitful harvest.</p>

## The Solution
<p> Our website, "FarmEasy," features two AI models that, based on specific inputs such as soil ph, humidity, temperature, and other factors, estimate the best crops for a certain area as well as the best fertilisers. Not only that, but our website also offers the opportunity to buy high-quality seeds online. This saves a significant amount of time and work. </p>
